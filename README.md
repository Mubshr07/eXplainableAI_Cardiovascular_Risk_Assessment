## üìå Project Description
<p style="text-align: justify;">This project presents a deep learning-based predictive model for early detection of **Coronary Heart Disease** using patient health data. The model is built on a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy and interpretability of medical diagnoses. The dataset (NHANES) used includes **51 features** and **37,079 records**, offering a comprehensive view of patient health profiles.</p>

Key highlights of the project include:

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Preprocessing Techniques**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing class imbalance using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.
- üß† **Model Architecture**: A customized deep learning model to effectively capture important features related to heart disease.
- üìä **Evaluation Metrics**: The model achieves strong performance with:
  - **Accuracy**: 97.10%
  - **Precision**: 96.40%
  - **Recall (Sensitivity)**: 97.85%
  - **AUC-ROC Score**: 0.97
- üß† **Model Explainability**: Utilization of **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to interpret and visualize feature contributions towards predictions, ensuring transparency and trust in the model's decisions.

This project contributes to the healthcare domain by combining the power of neural networks and explainable AI (XAI) techniques, enabling the deployment of reliable and interpretable heart disease prediction systems.
